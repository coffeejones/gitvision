// Regex-fallback plugin.
//
// Wraps the per-language regex parsers in lib/graph.ts so all 7 currently-
// supported non-JS languages (Java, Kotlin, C#, PHP, Ruby, Python, Go) feed
// into the codeAnalysis pipeline alongside the tree-sitter JS/TS plugin.
//
// What it produces:
//   - imports (with the original kind: import/extends/implements/renders)
// What it doesn't produce:
//   - functions, calls, complexity (regex parsers can't reliably extract
//     these — that's the point of moving to tree-sitter eventually)
//
// This plugin uses the parseDirect path. tree-sitter methods are intentionally
// unset; the orchestrator picks parseDirect when present.
//
// Migration story: as we add a tree-sitter plugin per language (one file
// each, same pattern as javascript.ts), the regex-fallback plugin's extension
// list shrinks. When the last language is migrated, this file goes away and
// lib/graph.ts can be deleted entirely.

 *  for the Imports tab (Spring MVC convention).
 *
 *  Migrations: Python → tree-sitter in v0.12, Go → tree-sitter in v0.13,
 *  Java → tree-sitter in v0.14, C# → tree-sitter in v0.21, PHP →
 *  tree-sitter in v0.22, Ruby → tree-sitter in v0.23. Only Kotlin remains
 *  on regex — its tree-sitter migration was attempted in v0.20 but blocked
 *  on WASM ABI mismatch (see PROGRESS.md "Kotlin WASM blocker"). HTML and
 *  CSS stay here as render-target file types (we don't extract anything
 *  from them, but they're needed in the FileIndex for Spring MVC controller
 *  → template "renders" edges). */
